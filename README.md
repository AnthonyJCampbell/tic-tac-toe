# Tic-Tac-Toe
A small side-project to build a Tic-Tac-Toe game

*** Write-Up: ***
-> _Holder Component_ with the board
-> _The board_ consists of three _rows_ with _three cells_ each.
    Each uses `display: flex;`
-> _Menu Component_ with buttons to select difficulty (1-3 scale) and a `start` button.
    When `start` is clicked, the game commences with a fresh state.
-> When the game commences, a coin flip will be simulated, deciding who -either the player or AI- will move first.
-> _Choosing Difficulty_ will be a stretch goal
-> In addition, the ability to change the size of the board and winning conditions (i.e. making the board 5X5) will be a stretch goal as well.
